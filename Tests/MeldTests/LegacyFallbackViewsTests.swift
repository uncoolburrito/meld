/// Construction-level tests for the legacy fallback views used on macOS 15.

/// SwiftUI views can't have their `body` evaluated outside of a hosting
/// renderer, so these tests are deliberately narrow: they verify the view
/// values can be constructed with realistic inputs and that the stored
/// properties survive `init`. The end-to-end behavior is covered by the
/// matching UI tests in `KasetUITests` running on the macos-15 CI leg.
